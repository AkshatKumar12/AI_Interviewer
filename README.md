# AI Interviewer
## Project Description

The AI Interviewer is an intelligent system designed to simulate real technical interviews. Using the Gemini-2.0 LLM API, it can generate realistic interview questions, evaluate responses, provide hints, and give feedback, mimicking the experience of interacting with a human interviewer.

### The project is particularly useful for:

Students and job seekers preparing for coding interviews.

Educators and trainers who want a virtual interview assistant.

Developers aiming to understand AI-based conversation systems.

## Key Features

Realistic Interview Simulation
The AI can simulate multiple rounds of interviews, including problem-solving, conceptual questions, and scenario-based queries.

Interactive Questioning
Users can answer questions, and the AI can follow up based on the responses, just like a real interview.

Feedback and Hints
The system provides guidance if a user is stuck, helping them improve without giving away the full answer.

Backend-Frontend Architecture

Backend: Handles API calls to Gemini-2.0, manages sessions, and logs user interactions.

Frontend: Provides an interactive interface (currently via main.py) for users to chat with the AI interviewer.

Extensible
New question sets, evaluation metrics, or AI models can be integrated easily.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Gemini-2.0 API (for AI responses)

Libraries: requests, streamlit (if frontend UI is web-based), pickle/json (for data storage)

Optional GUI: Tkinter / PyQt / Streamlit

How It Works

User starts the frontend (main.py).

Frontend sends questions/responses to the backend (backend.py).

Backend queries the Gemini-2.0 API to generate interview questions or feedback.

Backend sends AI responses back to the frontend.

Users interact and the system logs responses for later review.

## Description
AI Interviewer simulates technical interviews using the Gemini-2.0 LLM API.

## Setup
1. Add your Gemini-2.0 API key in `Backend.py`.
2. Install dependencies:


## Usage
- Interact with the AI interviewer through the frontend.
- Messages will be logged and responses are generated using Gemini-2.0 API.
